# Problem Description and Project Proposal
Almost everyone who listens to music has experienced the frustration of hearing a great song, forgetting to Shazam it, and then struggling to find it again because it never came back on. Furthermore, the use of traditional search engines often return inaccurate results, and manually searching through streaming platforms can be frustrating. While Shazam is popularly utilized for song identification, it strangely isn't well suited for identifying songs based on someone humming the melody or mumbling the lyrics. I propose developing a Song Finder App, a mobile and web application that allows users to search for songs through voice input.

# Primary Audience
The primary users of this application are music lovers who often find themselves trying to recall a song from memory.
